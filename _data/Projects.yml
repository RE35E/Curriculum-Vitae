  - title: "DreamFlix-Cinemas-POS"
    description: 
      - Collaboratively contributed to the development of a point-of-sale (POS) system tailored for cinema operations. The system supports key administrative functions such as managing movie schedules, staff records, timeslots, and seat bookings. It also features integrated tools for monitoring sales, income, and staff performance. My role involved co-designing and implementing core functionalities using C# as part of a group assignment.
